🧠 AI Journey - Day 2
✅ Topics Covered:
1. 🤖 What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)?
AI is the field of building machines or software that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence — like reasoning, learning, decision-making, and language understanding.

2. 🔍 Types of AI
Type	Description	Example
Narrow AI	Specialized in one task	Siri, Google Maps
General AI	Human-like thinking (not yet real)	A hypothetical self-aware AI
Super AI	Beyond human intelligence (theory)	Science fiction AI

3. 📊 Machine Learning (ML)
A subset of AI where machines learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
Supervised Learning: Learn from labeled data (e.g., spam detection)

Unsupervised Learning: Discover patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering)

Reinforcement Learning: Learn by reward/punishment (e.g., game playing)

4. 🧠 Deep Learning (DL)
A subfield of ML using neural networks, especially with many layers.

Common Use Cases:
Image recognition

Speech-to-text

Autonomous driving

5. 🎨 Generative AI (Gen AI)
AI that can generate new content like text, images, code, music, etc.

Examples:
ChatGPT → text generation

DALL·E → image generation

Codex → code generation

Technologies:
Large Language Models (LLMs)

Diffusion models

Transformers

6. 🕹️ Agentic AI / AI Agents
Systems that autonomously perform tasks or make decisions with minimal human input.

Features:
Goal-oriented behavior

Memory and reasoning

Tool use or API calling

Planning across steps

Examples:
AI Assistants (e.g., AutoGPT, BabyAGI)

Game AI agents

Robotics control agents
