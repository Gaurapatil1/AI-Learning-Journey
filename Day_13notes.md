# Day 13 â€“ Linear Algebra Basics

## 1. Vectors
- A vector is an ordered list of numbers.
- Represents magnitude & direction.
- Example: v = [2, 3] â†’ can represent movement 2 units right, 3 units up.

## 2. Matrices
- A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.
- Example:
  A = [[1, 2],
       [3, 4]]
- Rows = horizontal, Columns = vertical.

## 3. Matrix Operations
- **Addition**: Add element-wise.
- **Multiplication**: Dot product.
- **Transpose**: Flip rows â†” columns.
- **Identity Matrix (I)**: Diagonal of 1s, rest 0s.

## 4. Real-World Example
- Images are stored as matrices of pixels.
- Example: A 28x28 grayscale image = 784 numbers in a matrix.
