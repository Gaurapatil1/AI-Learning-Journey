# Day 14 â€“ Vectors in Linear Algebra (AI Journey)

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Vector?
- A **vector** is a quantity with **magnitude and direction**.
- In AI/ML, data is often represented as vectors.

Example:
- Row Vector â†’ [1, 2, 3]  
- Column Vector â†’  
  [1  
   2  
   3]

## âž• Vector Operations
1. **Addition**  
   [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6]

2. **Subtraction**  
   [5, 6] - [2, 3] = [3, 3]

3. **Scalar Multiplication**  
   2 Ã— [1, 2, 3] = [2, 4, 6]

4. **Dot Product**  
   [1, 2] Â· [3, 4] = (1Ã—3 + 2Ã—4) = 11  
   â†’ Used in **similarity** (cosine similarity in NLP).

## ðŸ”¥ Why Vectors in AI?
- Images = pixel vectors  
- Words = word embeddings (word2vec, GloVe)  
- Deep learning models = vector/matrix operations  

Vectors are the **language of AI**.
