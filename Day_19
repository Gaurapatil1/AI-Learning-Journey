📘 Day 19 – Challenge: Factorial of a Number


---

🏆 Main Challenge: Compute Factorial

// Input: n
let n = 5;

// Step 1: Create a variable to store result
let factorial = 1;

// Step 2: Multiply numbers from 1 to n
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  factorial = factorial * i;
}

// Step 3: Print the result
console.log(factorial); // Output: 120 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)

👉 Kid-style explanation:
Imagine you are stacking chairs 🪑.
On Day 1 → 1 chair, Day 2 → 2 chairs on top, Day 3 → 3 chairs, … until Day N.
At the end → you see how many different ways you can stack them → that’s factorial! 🎉

📝 Assignment 1: Total Combinations

let n = 4;
let fact = 1;

for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  fact = fact * i;
}

console.log(fact); // Output: 24

👉 If you have 4 toys, how many different ways can you arrange them? → 24 ways!

📝 Assignment 2: Factorial of Daily Sales

let sales = [2, 3, 4];
let factorials = [];

// Helper function to compute factorial
function getFactorial(num) {
  let f = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    f = f * i;
  }
  return f;
}

// Loop through sales
for (let i = 0; i < sales.length; i++) {
  factorials.push(getFactorial(sales[i]));
}

console.log(factorials); // Output: [2, 6, 24]

👉 Day 1 you sold 2 → 2! = 2
Day 2 you sold 3 → 3! = 6
Day 3 you sold 4 → 4! = 24
So output = [2, 6, 24]

📝 Assignment 3: Product of Order Quantities

let order_quantity = 6;
let result = 1;

for (let i = 1; i <= order_quantity; i++) {
  result = result * i;
}

console.log(result); // Output: 720
