# Day 16 – Linear Algebra (Part 3)

## 1. Matrix Operations
- **Addition/Subtraction:** Element-wise
- **Multiplication:**
  - Matrix × Matrix
  - Matrix × Vector
- **Transpose:** Flipping rows ↔ columns
- **Identity Matrix:** Like 1 in multiplication
- **Inverse Matrix:** Like dividing by a matrix

## 2. Example

A = [[1, 2],  
     [3, 4]]

B = [[5, 6],  
     [7, 8]]

A × B = [[19, 22],  
         [43, 50]]

## 3. Why Important in AI?
- **Images** → stored as pixel matrices
- **Word embeddings (NLP)** → stored as matrices
- **Neural networks** → forward & backward propagation use matrix multiplications

✅ Conclusion: Without matrices, ML/DL wouldn’t exist!
