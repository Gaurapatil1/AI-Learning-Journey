# Day 15 – Probability & Statistics (AI Math Foundations)

Today I focused on the **basics of Probability & Statistics** which are essential for Machine Learning and AI.

## 📌 Key Topics Learned

### 1. Probability
- **Probability** = Likelihood of an event occurring.
- Formula:  
  \[
  P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}
  \]

✅ Example: Toss a coin.  
- Probability of getting Heads = 1/2  
- Probability of getting Tails = 1/2  

---

### 2. Random Variables
- A variable that represents possible outcomes of a random process.  
- **Discrete** → (like dice rolls: 1–6)  
- **Continuous** → (like height, weight, temperature)  

---

### 3. Probability Distributions
- **Uniform Distribution** – Every outcome has equal chance.  
- **Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)** – Most values are around the mean.  

✅ Example: Students’ test scores often follow a normal distribution.

### 4. Statistics
- **Mean (Average):**  
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of values}}{\text{Number of values}}
  \]

- **Median:** Middle value when data is sorted.  
- **Mode:** Most frequently occurring value.  
- **Variance:** Measure of spread of data.  
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** Square root of variance → tells how much data deviates from mean.

## 🔑 Why Important for AI?
- ML algorithms like **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks** rely on probability.  
- Statistics helps in **data analysis, feature selection, and understanding data distributions.**

## 📝 Example Problem
A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls.  
- Total = 5  
- Probability of picking a red ball = 3/5  
- Probability of picking a blue ball = 2/5
